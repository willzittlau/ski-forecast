# Ski/Weather Forecast app
**For a live demo, please visit https://skiforecast.herokuapp.com/**

This is a personal weather forecast app I made to streamline the process when I'm looking at which areas to ski in the winter. 

It's written using Flask in python3, and deployed to Heroku using MongoDB as the database. It queries its sister API to dynamically generate page content. Jinja is used along with some vanilla JS to create the dynamic content. Add in some HTML for structure and the CSS is mainly from Pure-CSS.

## Usage

Use this site as much as youd like!! :) message me if you want a specific area added.

## Limitations

This site queries SpotWX and Avalanche Canada to generate data. It may break if the structure of either of these sites changes. Currently it will only work for areas in Canada due to using Avalanche Canada avy forecast data.

Let me know any changes you'd want to see!
